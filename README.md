## API


### Get

* `key`: Which item to retreive

```Javascript
cache
  .get('andrew')
  .then(
    function(val) {
      console.log('Andrew is ' + val + ' on Twitter')
    },
    function(err) {
      console.log(err);
    }
  );
```

### Set

* `key`: What to set the item in the cache under
* `object`: What to cache
* `expires` (optional): How long until the item expires out of the cache, in milliseconds

```Javascript
cache
  .set('andrew', { username : 'andrewhathaway' })
  .then(
    function() {
      console.log('Andrew has been put in the cache');
    },
    function(err) {
      console.log(err);
    }
  );
```

### Delete

* `key`: Which item to delete

```Javascript
cache
  .del('andrew')
  .then(
    function() {
      console.log('Andrew has been deleted from the cache');
    },
    function(err) {
      console.log(err);
    }
  );
```
